        "Having SQL syntax at your fingertips ensures you are able to get data fast, understand complex databases quickly and spend more time on analysis. Using SQL to filter and roll up data before bringing it into another tool is especially helpful when working with very large datasets. In this session we will look at basic SQL syntax; selecting data from tables, filtering and working with data types. We will then look at Joins and aggregate measures.\n",

        "\n",

        "Consider a situation where a table has missing rows — eg if our Region table above was missing some region ids that were present in the main Avocado table.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this situation, an INNER JOIN would cause us to lose any rows without a corresponding region id, so here we might want to use a left, right or outer join to keep all rows in the Avocado table.\n",
